- This repository contains an implementation of fixed-point analysis for digital filters
 - The fixed-point analysis has been written in c++ and a dll file has been created to be used in python
 - The connection between python and c++ is through ctypes library
 - The .so file has also been created
 - The following example is the quantization of the coefficients of an FIR filter
 - The number of taps is 13 and the number of fractional parts is 4 bits
